      In its broadest sense, art is a form of communication. It means whatever
      the artist intends it to mean, and this meaning is shaped by the
      materials, techniques, and forms it makes use of, as well as the ideas and
      feelings it creates in its viewers. Art is an act of expressing feelings,
      thoughts, and observations. I have done quite a few paintings and
      portraits myself.
