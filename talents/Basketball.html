    Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops, is a team sport in which two
    teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
    rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a
    basketball through the defender's hoop in diameter mounted 10 feet while
    preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop. I have
